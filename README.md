## Welcome to my profile page.
My name is Frank, and I'm a researcher and passionate educator currently working in the higher education sector = and more importantly in the GitHub context, I'm also a hopeless technology enthusiast.

As my work focuses on project management and my main hobby is home automation, GitHub is an interesting area for me: I get to apply my work knowledge to my hobby.
So, this page here *mostly* focuses on my hobby.

Note that I have just started working with GitHub more extensively in 2026. Before that, I never used it in a structured way. That said, I'm looking forward to putting my projects on here over time - and who knows, maybe someone in the community finds some it helpful or at least interesting.  
So, all of this here, including the page you're reading right now, is a work in progress.

### Projects I work(ed) on in my "spare time" include:
- Setting up my own local LLM-based automations
  - using tools like Docker, Ollama, N8N and OpenWebUI
- Creating automated marking support tools using local Ollama LLMs and N8N
- Creating an automated project administration bot that writes draft responses to e-mail queries about a project
- Creating a rain water tank level sensor, using Arduino (and ESP Home?)
- Continously improve my home automation (using Home Assistant)
  - improving use of solar energy by automating
    -  electric water heater operation
    -  HVAC operation
    -  washing machine operation
  -  improving heat management by automating
    - window blinds
    - HVAC operation
